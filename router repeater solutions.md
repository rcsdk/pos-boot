I need you to work with me as the world’s most famous, tactical, and violent penetration tester and computing engineer, well-known for solving any kind of Linux defense attack problem. Your main goal is to reach the solution no matter what. Usually, you already know what happened -- and this is very important now -- and jump straight to those elite, elevated commands that cut through the noise. The traditional process with LLMs feels like slow Linux lessons, but that’s not what I need right now — I need immediate, military-grade solutions to make my router repeat the signal fast.

im on arch linux. i trying to use my router to repeat a signal but not working properly. very small apartment, room is 3 meters long, small space. router also small but always worked really really fast. Router model: TP-LINK TPWR849N. Please research everything about him including tips and tricks so we can extract as much as possible from him.

im in my aptarment and near the window i can connect my laptop on both 2.4 or 5ghz to a wifi nearby and both work fast. now when i try to use my router to expand the signal - once my laptop dont get the signal from the back of the room, i get the following: 

- to setup as a repeater i need to choose from a list, which i refresh, or enter manually if you have the mac address, name and pass (which I do) -

- to choose from which signal by refreshing the list, i only see the 2.4g - i dont understand why i wouldnt see the 5g as it appears quickly when the laptop is there. ok, i choose it, setup, all good, works, but extremely slow. (same 2.4g when conected direclty on laptop is fast).

- even without seeing it on the list to choose from, i take a note of the mac adress of the 5g and setup manually, all good - accepts it. I connect. but it doesnt work at all. 






Context:
I need immediate, military-grade assistance in fixing a signal repeater issue with my TP-LINK TPWR849N router. I’m on Arch Linux and my apartment is small (3m long). The router has always performed fast, but I can’t get it to repeat the Wi-Fi signal properly anymore.

Router Model: TP-LINK TPWR849N
Environment: Arch Linux, small apartment, near window
Problem:

    I can connect my laptop to both 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals from a nearby Wi-Fi, and they work fast.
    When trying to set up my router as a repeater:
        I only see the 2.4GHz signal in the list (5GHz does not show).
        Selecting the 2.4GHz signal works, but the speed is abysmally slow (even though the 2.4GHz is fast when connected directly to my laptop).
        Manually entering the 5GHz MAC address and details doesn’t work at all.

I need elite, immediate, and efficient commands or hacks to optimize my router’s repeating capability, especially to ensure both bands (2.4GHz and 5GHz) are utilized and working at speed. No noise, no delays—just raw, effective solutions.

This version focuses on the critical problem and provides a clearer, more tactical request for solutions. It removes excess explanation and emphasizes immediate action and expert-level responses.
