Robby: 
I clicked on the new chat - did we lose the one we were on?
Aria: 
No worries! When you click on the new chat, you don't lose the previous conversation. You can easily switch back to it anytime. Just look for the chat history on the side, and you can pick up right where we left off! If you have any other questions or need assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
Robby: 
Where is that
Aria: 
It seems like you're asking about a specific location, but I need a bit more context to help you out! Are you looking for directions to a place, information about a city, or something else entirely? Just let me know, and I'll be happy to assist! ðŸ˜Š
Robby: 
Where can I find the previous chat we were talking just now?
Aria:
