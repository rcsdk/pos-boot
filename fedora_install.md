need help to install fedora and install refind as boot - with max security as i have a very severe bootkit that tempers everryhing. I o system rescue on RAM, and i cant boot.i need to do all from here, or he tempers. I already have the iso here,just downloaded.
I dont have access to the bios - password from bootkit - and we can leave that for now.
disk total = 1 tera. I created parititons for EFI, root, swap (32gb ) and the rest to use later for other distros. goal today is to have fedora running with no tempering.

 i like some ideas here (i know its arch - but some ideas are good) - https://r0ttenbeef.github.io/Custom-Secure-Penetration-Testing-Arch-Linux-Installtion/
