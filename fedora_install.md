Absolutely, let's take your setup to the next level. Given your critical security needs—facing a severe bootkit, limited BIOS access, and requiring an ultra-secure Fedora installation with Refind—I'll provide a **military-grade** security-focused strategy that goes beyond standard hardening. This will combine the latest techniques from 2023-2024, advanced hardening practices, and zero-trust principles to prevent any tampering or unauthorized access.

### **Ultimate Security Plan for Fedora Installation with Refind and Anti-Tampering Measures**

---

### **Step 1: Boot Process & Refind Configuration**

#### **1.1. Refind with Secure Boot (Absolute Integrity)**  
Since you're dealing with a bootkit and have no BIOS access, securing the boot process is critical. Refind needs to be installed and configured to operate **with Secure Boot enabled**, using **signed boot files** and **trusted keys**.

1. **Reflashing the Bootloader**:  
   If you haven't already, install Refind with a **trusted key**. The process may involve re-flashing the bootloader in a way that doesn't interact with the tampered bootkit. Use a USB stick with Refind’s bootloader files copied over and **Secure Boot enabled**. This will ensure that only signed code runs in the boot sequence, avoiding tampered loaders.

2. **Enroll Custom Keys for Secure Boot**:  
   - Generate your own **Secure Boot key pair** (public/private) using **OpenSSL**.
   - Enroll the public key into the firmware to sign your kernel and bootloader files securely.
   - **Secure Boot** must reject any unsigned or tampered files, even if the bootkit tries to inject malicious code into the boot process.

3. **Bootloader Integrity Checks**:  
   Use **Verified Boot** to monitor the integrity of the bootloader files and kernel at boot time. Refind can be configured to verify the hashes of essential files before booting the OS.

#### **1.2. Minimal Interaction (Silent Boot)**  
To reduce the window of opportunity for the bootkit to tamper, set **Refind’s timeout to zero** (or an ultra-low value), so it boots directly into Fedora without displaying the menu.  
- **Timeout**: Set it to `0` to automatically boot Fedora.  
- **No menu**: This minimizes tampering opportunities by restricting user interaction with the bootloader menu.

---

### **Step 2: Filesystem & Partition Security**

#### **2.1. Advanced Filesystem Hardening (Btrfs with Subvolumes & Immutable Settings)**  
Btrfs provides powerful security features, and we will configure it to offer **immutable filesystems** and **snapshot** protection to ensure no changes can occur without detection.

1. **Root Filesystem Setup**:  
   Use **Btrfs** for the root filesystem. Enable **compression** and **checksum** on your files for additional integrity checks.
   - Mount options: Use `noexec, nosuid, nodev` for all critical partitions.  
   - Configure **subvolumes**: Create subvolumes for key parts of your system (`/root`, `/var`, `/home`, etc.), which can be individually snapshotted and rolled back if tampered with.

2. **Immutable Files**:  
   Use the **chattr** command to make certain critical files immutable, such as kernel configuration, `/etc/passwd`, and system binaries.
   - `chattr +i /etc/passwd /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
   - This ensures these files can't be modified, even by the root user or bootkit.

3. **Snapshotting & Rollbacks**:  
   Enable automatic Btrfs snapshots of the system at key points (e.g., after installation, after updates). This allows you to easily roll back to a known good state if any tampering is detected.
   - Set up **snapper** for regular snapshots.
   - Use `btrfs send/receive` to back up snapshots to an external drive.

#### **2.2. Full Disk Encryption with LUKS (Non-Negotiable)**  
Even with Secure Boot and Refind, you must protect the data at rest. This requires **LUKS encryption** on your root and swap partitions to prevent the bootkit from reading sensitive data.

1. **Encrypt Entire Disk**:  
   - Encrypt both the **root** and **swap** partitions using LUKS (`cryptsetup`).
   - Use a **very strong passphrase** for LUKS encryption and store it in a separate, secure location (e.g., an offline USB device).

2. **Swap Partition Hardening**:  
   Disable **swap off** during installation, and if necessary, add swap encryption to ensure that no sensitive data is ever written unprotected to disk.

---

### **Step 3: Kernel Hardening & Anti-Tampering Configuration**

#### **3.1. Kernel Module Signing (Tamper-Resistant Kernel)**  
To prevent the bootkit from loading malicious kernel modules, enforce **module signing** to only allow the loading of trusted kernel modules.

1. **Enable Module Signing**:  
   - Enable **module signing** in the kernel configuration (`CONFIG_MODULE_SIG=y`).
   - Sign your kernel modules with your custom key (use OpenSSL to generate a key pair and then sign the modules with `sign-file`).

2. **Secure Kernel Compilation**:  
   - Use the **grsecurity** patchset or **PaX** to harden the kernel, making it more resistant to exploits.
   - Enable features like **Control Flow Integrity (CFI)**, **Stack Canaries**, and **KASLR** (Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization) to prevent exploitation.

#### **3.2. SELinux in Enforcing Mode**  
Leverage **SELinux** for mandatory access control. SELinux can limit the actions of processes even if the root account is compromised.

1. **Configure SELinux**:  
   - Set SELinux to **Enforcing Mode** during installation: `setenforce 1`.
   - Define strict policies for critical services to ensure that even compromised services can’t harm the system.

2. **SELinux for Custom Applications**:  
   If you’re running custom applications, enforce **custom SELinux policies** to minimize the risk of exploitation.

---

### **Step 4: Real-Time Monitoring & Intrusion Detection**

#### **4.1. AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection)**  
Implement **AIDE** (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) to track filesystem changes and alert you to any modifications.

1. **AIDE Setup**:  
   - Install and configure **AIDE** to scan system files for integrity. This can alert you when any file in critical system directories has been tampered with.
   - Set up **periodic scans** using cron jobs and integrate it with **email alerts**.

2. **Auditd**:  
   Use **auditd** to track system calls and log suspicious activities, such as attempts to modify critical files.
   - Set up **audit rules** to log failed login attempts and changes to the bootloader, kernel, and system files.

---

### **Step 5: Anti-Network & Remote Attacks**

#### **5.1. Firewalld & Network Isolation**  
Your system should be isolated from external threats as much as possible.

1. **Firewalld Hardening**:  
   - Set up **firewalld** to only allow essential services (e.g., SSH, HTTP/HTTPS). Deny all incoming connections by default.
   - Implement **IP-based access controls** for SSH, restricting connections only to trusted IPs.

2. **Disable Unused Services**:  
   Disable **IPv6** if not needed, and turn off any unused services (like printing or non-essential daemons).

3. **Network Traffic Inspection**:  
   - Use **tcpdump** or **Wireshark** to inspect incoming/outgoing traffic for suspicious activity.
   - Set up **intrusion prevention systems** like **Suricata** to detect and block suspicious network traffic.

---

### **Step 6: Backup & Recovery Strategy**

#### **6.1. Immutable Backups**  
Ensure that your backups are **immutable**, so they cannot be altered by the bootkit or any attackers.

1. **Offsite Backups**:  
   Use a **remote or offline backup** strategy (e.g., using **rclone** to sync critical backups to an encrypted cloud location).
   - Encrypt your backups using **GPG** or **OpenSSL**.

2. **Immutable Backup Storage**:  
   Store backups on **write-once, read-many (WORM)** media, or use **immutable storage** on cloud services (e.g., Amazon S3 with versioning and deletion protection).

---

### **Final Thoughts**  
With this **ultimate-level security** plan, you’ll have taken every precaution to prevent any tampering from the bootkit while ensuring your Fedora system is hardened against all known attack vectors. The use of **Secure Boot**, **LUKS encryption**, **SELinux**, **Btrfs with snapshots**, **kernel signing**, and **real-time monitoring** will create a highly resilient environment that significantly limits potential attack surfaces.
